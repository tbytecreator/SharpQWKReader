Although fast food isn't necessarily healthy or has the best ingredients, I think it can be okay in moderation, to pick up some fast food every so often. What are some of your favorite fast food items (i.e., favorite burger, favorite Mexican food, & so on)?„„This could have been a poll, but there are a lot of fast food places, some which are also regional..„„For me:„„Burgers:„Wendy's has been a favorite of mine recently. I like their Dave's burgers (single or double) - I think they're tasty, and they seem fairly fresh too (and they say their burger patties are never frozen - maybe that's true?).„„Also, for value, I think Red Robin's Tavern Double is a pretty good burger at a good price.  And yesterday, I saw that Red Robin has a meal deal where you can get one of their Tavern Double burgers, fries, and a soft drink for $9.99. That's cheaper than some fast food places..„„I also like A&W's Papa Burger, Burger King's Whopper, and In-N-Out burgers.„„There's a local northwest burger chain in my area called Burgerville, and I think they make pretty good burgers too.„„„Mexican fast food:„Admittedly I do like Taco Bell sometimes, but also Del Taco and Taco Time (and I think Taco Time is mainly in the northwest US).  I think Baja Fresh and Victorico's are pretty good too.„„„Pizza:„These days, my favorites tend to be Papa Murphy's, Round Table, and a couple that are more regional here (Abby's Legendary Pizza and Belaggio's).  For value, I think Little Caesar's isn't bad for the price.„„Nightfox„„---„ ˛ Synchronet ˛ Digital Distortion: digitaldistortionbbs.com„                7714   12-31-2516:30All                      Nightfox                 Favorite fast food items             7713    5     ·°     Re: Favorite fast food items„  By: Nightfox to All on Wed Dec 31 2025 04:25 pm„„To add to my list of favorite fast food places - Sandwiches: Jersey Mike's has been a favorite of mine lately.

My wife was big on ghost shows at the time, where they all do lockdowns, etc. So when we planned the stay in Peoria she looked up haunted places to go. We stayed at the haunted hotel for a night, in their main suite with a giant bay window facing the parking lot (we were a group of 4). We did a ghost tour and also visited Maynard's winery/bar, although I didn't know Reznor had anything there. Checked out a bunch of little gift shops, and we also ate at the "Haunted Hamburger" and got some t-shirts.„„It was a fun two day trip.

Also a T1.„„Went from that to bay networks 5000 chasis with 48 port cards and a ds3. The BBS was mostly forgotten then in the background. Went from Bay Networks to Cisco 5200's, a coupla sun 6000's.

During this time, I have seen FTNs and BBSs come and„go.

And I, as the "idea initiator" of this project, am doing all„of this entirely on my own, and that takes more time, as needed in a real„community, which also has a genuine interest in promoting this wonderful hobby„in a best possible way! I already wrote, 25,000 verifiable clicks per month.„The forum is definitely being noticed.„„So why not make the best of it? The hobby has so many great facets! I„understand people who on one hand say they like BBSs but demonize the„Internet. On the other hand, I have to say.. true, it has contributed to the„User Target group being there and many sysops too! But everyone takes„advantage of this internet flat rate, in contrast to the horrendous telephone„costs we had monthly in the 90s. (just only one example of the benefits)„Just imagine if 200ñ300 Sysops from the about 1500-2000 worldwide would„dedicate 10 minutes of their valuable time each week or month to various„activities (hardware/software/doors/scene/FTN/ANSI/ASCII), in addition to my„own efforts. I can see that it (announcements, new BBSs, etc.) seems possible„on other platforms, besides the FTN. Nobody can deny!„„One could also put forward the thesis that this forum reflects the disarray of„the sysop scene? That would also be an explanation, wouldn't it?„„It would be wonderful and very helpful if more of you would make an effort and„contribute a small part. Many of you have far more knowledge of the subject„than I could ever learn in the rest of my life. With you, the forum can become„and be significantly definitely better! A great showcase for our hobby! And of„course, with the necessary patience for the development too!„„And I stick to my thesis that all the fragmentation across the many portals,„and even more so on the commercial ones, has not been beneficial to the„thematic presentation of this hobby and still isn't. A thematic focus would„certainly bring more to the hobby and to those interested in it!„„What certainly won't happen is that I give up the project, which by now has„cost not only a lot of my time but also not insignificant amount of money.„„...

I think Taco Bell & Burger King used to also have some good deals in their apps, but not so much anymore.  A few years ago, Taco Bell's $5 box was a pretty good deal, but they started to raise the price (about $5.50 and then $6), and now they don't have that deal anymore.  They still have the boxes, but they're a bit different and they're about $9 or more where I am.„„Also, a few years ago, Burger King had a deal in their app where you could get a Whopper meal with small fries & medium drink for about $5 (and then $6), and sometimes 2 Whopper meals for $9. Not anymore now.  They still have that Whopper meal deal in their app, but they want something like $10.49, even with the deal in their app.  I think that's pretty crazy.  I've heard Burger King isn't doing very well and is having to close some of their locations, and I think I see why.„„Nightfox„„---„ ˛ Synchronet ˛ Digital Distortion: digitaldistortionbbs.com„                    8487   01-24-2618:53MIKE POWELL              MRO                      Bbsing                               8485    9     ·°     Re: Bbsing„  By: MIKE POWELL to UTOPIAN GALT on Sat Jan 24 2026 09:11 am„„ > > I am thinking with government restrictions in Australia and the„ > > United Kingdo we should be using BBSing as an alternative medium.„ > > Its akin to HAM radio now„„ > > You should not need to submit your ID just to use a bloody search„ > > engine.„„ > A lot of this could be avoided if parents were more aware of what„ > their children were up to online, and also if the didn't look at„ > tablets and phones as something to keep the kid occupied (and out of„ > their hair).„„„i didnt let my son online.„„well one time i let him sign up to a forum for his guild in a game he played.„that's about it.„„then my step daughter's mom let her go online and use her phone and she „catfished a bunch of guys. she got her phone taken away like 10x.„„they werent old guys but older boys.„one kid i went on fb and told his grandma on him.„„---„ ˛ Synchronet ˛ ::: BBSES.info - free BBS services :::„                                                      8488   01-25-2611:24MRO                      deon                     Re: BBSING                           8483    4     ·°     Re: Re: BBSING„  By: MRO to deon on Sat Jan 24 2026 04:51 pm„„Howdy,„„ >  > I'm always amused by statements like this.„ >„ > the goverments made announcements.„„If they did, I would have thought we'd know about it...„„„...ÎÓÂÔ„„---„ ˛ Synchronet ˛ AnsiTEX bringing back videotex but with ANSI„                                                                                          8489   01-24-2619:10morningstarr             MRO                      you suck                             8462    7     ·°     Re: Re: Still Active„  By: poindexter FORTRAN to Morningstarr on Sat Jan 24 2026 09:59 am„„ > -=> Morningstarr wrote to The Wanderer <=-„„ >  Mo> I tried to install synchronet in linux today..outcome was negative.„ >  Mo> I watched robs video and rtfm and still no luck.„„you sure you didn't spend all your time talking to chatgpt so you„could post insults by proxy about me,  deuce and echicken?„„i see that garbage you posted on bbs carnival.„„„--„"Before using Wildcat....This Company did not have a convenient way of„looking after some of the richest clients in the world...Now we do!" „---„ ˛ Synchronet ˛ ::: BBSES.info - free BBS services :::„                                                                                                                     8490   01-24-2618:56deon                     Arelor                   Re: BBSING                           8481    9     ·°     Re: Re: BBSING„  By: deon to Arelor on Sun Jan 25 2026 08:26 am„„ >„ > I'm always amused by statements like this.„ >„ > Where do I need to show my "hard ID"?„„1) I have said they have been acting bonkers about it and planning to enforce it for years, not that they have those plans deployed necessarily.„„2) Spain has openly been planning to enforce soft cryptographical identification and the standards they intend to use to enforce them are public.„„3) "The laws, which were brought in at the beginning of October, require people in the UK to prove they are 18 or older before being allowed to access adult content online.

Thank you for your constructive suggestions!„I would like to first comment on the upper section, if that's alright?„„This is relatively easy to explain. At the end of 2023, I started to seriously„engage with the topic of BBS again. I hadn't done anything for 23 years; I was„never really the programmer either (probably no talent for something like„that).„„What struck me back then, besides the Wildcat Interactive Net Server that was„used/choiced, was that in addition to the language problems (English - German,„technical English - technical German), you had to search a long time on the„WWW before you could get a rough overview of the hobby. Perhaps this is also„because, over the 23 years, I have inevitably just gotten 23 years older? I„don't want to dispute that right now!„„Long story short: I was never the programmer, more of a user of existing„software. My talent is therefore limited.„„The forum software was therefore purchased after I had weighed the pros and„cons of the software available on the market a little. The add-ons as well.„If the timing works out, I will also tackle the wiki.„„Let's move on to the next point: I had to start with something within the„scope of my mental capabilities and skills. And maybe I am taking the easier„route for me? So I focused on the content first. Unfortunately, a forum is not„really suitable, or barely suitable at all, for properly describing and„categorizing mass uploads. So each program, tool, utility, door, door game,„and and and, must be entered and descriped individually.„„Therefore, since I am now hanging around as a one man show, I am„maintaining/adding programs, doors, and tools, etc., in this endless loop,„along with information (simple research) on the topic of BBS in the www.„„Since my day also only has 24 hours, and there is still a working life„(although due to my retirement it is no longer 220 days a year), but with the„German Armed Forces as a reservist for 5-7 months a year, alongside normal„family life, time is limited, as it is for many here.„„Regarding the connector in the Fido or FTN: Apart from the fact that, as„described above, I don't even have the time to learn the skills, I do have„some concerns about this possibility. I had mentioned that I don't want to see„the forum as competition to the BBSs or the Nets! The idea itself is quite„very appealing to me, although I have some legal concerns with one or another„network that uses real names!„„Therefore, I initially focused on introducing the respective still existing„FTN and mentioning contact persons (Zone Coordinators). Certainly, one could„further expand on the content, and I will most likely do so. But in my view,„the first step is to first highlight the diversity and history of this„wonderful and creative hobbies.„„All in all, the forum is explained by the personal facts of my person„described above and therefore develops more slowly than it would in a„collaborative effort where everyone can contribute their ideas and strengths.„And the fact that often, and now I will try to express myself cautiously,„things are depicted and discussed here and there mostly in a manner specific„to certain software. Broadly, that is, across all platforms and still existing„programs, actually to my knowledge, concentrated to one point not.„„All in all, I can still imagine many things that the forum could offer or„accomplish. But honestly, I rely on a bit of help for that. And everyone„reading along knows that it doesn't come and probably never will.„No blame! Just the reality.„„I can only keep repeating that I would be very happy if the project, the idea,„gained more approval.„„Mike„„... Platinum Xpress & Wildcat!.....

I bought one, because a local store had some on sale with a massive discount.  I actually thought it was a fun console. It had only one controller port (surprisingly), and there was an adapter that would give you 4 controller ports.  I don't think there were many games for it that were multiplayer though, for the same reason (having to buy an accessory to get multiple controller ports).„„When I use emulators these days, there are still a couple games I like to play for the TurboGrafX-16: Air Zonk (which is one of the more well-known games for it) and the Bomberman games that were made for it.„„Nightfox„„---„ ˛ Synchronet ˛ Digital Distortion: digitaldistortionbbs.com„                                                                                                        3681   01-08-2611:41Nightfox                 Arelor                   game consoles                        3680    5     ·§     Re: game consoles„  By: Nightfox to Arelor on Thu Jan 08 2026 08:44 am„„ > In the 16-bit days, there was a console called the TurboGrafX-16 (or PC„„That console was FREAKING AWESOME.

Is there any benefit anymore?„„Years ago, I think there was still a benefit in that a dedicated sound card typically had sound processing chips on it, whereas onboard audio on a motherboard would be very simplistic and would need CPU processing power for audio.  For that reason, I still used a dedicated sound card in my PCs for a while.  The last one I used was an Asus Xonar Xense in my last PC - I think it worked well.„„For my current PC (which I built in 2019), I decided to just use the onboard audio on the motherboard rather than buying a dedicated audio card, and I think it has been just fine.  I typically use a pair of stereo speakers, and I also have a headset with a mic that I sometimes use, plugged into the front audio ports.  My PC's motherboard uses a Realtek ALC1220P for audio - I've looked up specs and reviews, and it seems to be decent in that regard.„„One of my favorite sound cards that I had in the past was a Sound Blaster Audigy 2, which included an internal 5.25" front-facing panel with various audio inputs & outputs, as well as a MIDI input & output - I thought that was pretty cool.„„If you do have a need for better audio on a PC, I've heard people recommend an external audio interface these days (typically USB-based).„„Nightfox„„---„ ˛ Synchronet ˛ Digital Distortion: digitaldistortionbbs.com„                                                                                        1923   01-05-2614:53Nightfox                 Lonewolf                 Dedicated sound cards for            1922    8     ·•   Subject: Dedicated sound cards for a PC„  Re: Dedicated sound cards for a PC„  By: Nightfox to All on Mon Jan 05 2026 09:11 am„„ > What do you all think of using a dedicated sound card for a PC these days?„ > Is there any benefit anymore?„ > If you do have a need for better audio on a PC, I've heard people recommend„ > an external audio interface these days (typically USB-based).„ >„ > Nightfox„„I record music some, so I use an external USB Focusrite Scarlett audio interface.

But, you can go a step farther with MIDI files and use a software DAW like Cubase and assign virtual instruments VSTs to each track within the MIDI file and end up with a great sounding audio track. I recalled Al Stewart's Year of the Cat being a great one to do that with. In my earlier reply I mentioned an older Sound Blaster AWE32/64 card that I had that had these realistic instrument sounds embedded in the chip. Which sounded superior even to the one's on modern mother boards. I'm not sure if modern Sound Blaster's like the Z SE PCIe achieve the same, but I guess they would take some of the load off the CPU if doing some gaming etc. Anyway, my two cents.„„Lonewolf„---„ ˛ Synchronet ˛ Fireside BBS - AI-WX - firesidebbs.com:23231„                                                                                                                        1938   01-06-2614:52Mindsurfer               Nightfox                 Dedicated sound cards for            1936    6     ·•     Re: Dedicated sound cards for„  By: Mindsurfer to Nightfox on Tue Jan 06 2026 09:35 pm„„ Ni>> If you open up a MIDI file and play it (i.e., with a program like VLC),„ Ni>> chances are it will be using a software synthesizer built into Windows.„„ Mi> Microsoft GS Wavetable Synth,„ Mi> but it might be a bit far fedched to call it a synth.

There is the potential for glancing„influences late into January 3 from CMEs that left the Sun on„December 28 to 30. Additional enhancements are possible again on„January 4 with the possible indirect impact of the CME that left the„Sun on January 2.„„By early January 3 the arrival of the December 31 is expected to„cause unsettled to G1-G2 (Minor-Moderate) storming. Additional„geomagnetic storming is anticipated on January 4 with the possible„impact of the January 2 CME.„„Solar activity is expected to be predominately low through January„24, with C-class flares expected throughout the outlook period.„M-class flares (R1-R2/Minor-Moderate) range from a chance to likely„at times as active regions evolve and rotate on/off the disk.„X-class flares (R3-Strong or greater) range from a slight chance to„a chance during periods of enhanced active region complexity.„„Weekly Commentary on the Sun, the Magnetosphere, and the Earth's„Ionosphere, January 1, 2026, by F. K. Janda, OK1HH:„„"In mid-December 2025, we observed a relatively significant decline„in solar activity within the approximately 27-day fluctuation caused„by the rotation of the Sun. It seemed that the maximum of the„eleven-year cycle would end after a period of high activity in„2024-2025. However, a significant increase in solar activity in the„second half of December suggests the opposite-solar activity will„probably remain relatively high in 2026!„„"Based on increased flare activity, accompanied by coronal mass„ejections (CMEs) in the last days of 2025, geomagnetic disturbances„can be predicted in the first days of 2026. Their probability should„increase since January 1 (G1 level) until January 3 (when G2 level„can be expected). Calm days should follow since January 5.„„"In the current eleven-year cycle, we have become accustomed to the„fact that the parameters of the ionosphere differ from those„measured in previous cycles at the same level of solar activity. For„example, the critical frequencies of the F2 ionospheric layer are„significantly lower. This will probably also apply to the rest of„the cycle. Even so, the forecast of a slower decline in solar„activity is favorable for the shortwave propagation."„„Region 4330 was responsible for two eruptions seen in SUVI imagery.„The first was associated with a coronal mass ejection (CME), first„observed in coronagraph imagery December 30, 2025, and was closely„followed by a second CME from the northeast quadrant, potentially„from near Region 4324. None of their modeled trajectory indicated„direct impact near Earth. Further coronagraph images are necessary„to evaluate whether the second eruption from Region 4330 will result„in a visible CME. No other Earth-directed CME was observed during„the period.„ˇ„Solar activity is likely to be moderate with a chance for X-class„flares through January 2, 2026, due to the current magnetic„complexity and development of the active regions on the visible„solar disk.„ˇ„Periods of active conditions are likely on January 9 and 10 and on„January 12 to 14 due to negative polarity CH HSS influences.ˇ „„The latest solar report from Dr. Tamitha Skov, WX6SWW, can be found„on YouTube at:„https://youtu.be/jmeefUKgN6o?si=_cHekumd2JskrU_F[2] .„„The Predicted Planetary A Index for January 3, 2026 to January 9 is„15, 12, 5, 5, 5, 5, and 15, with a mean of 8.9ˇ Predicted Planetary„K Index is 4, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, and 4, with a mean of 2.9.„10.7-centimeter flux is 160, 155, 150, 155, 140, 130, and 125, with a„mean of 145.„„For more information concerning shortwave radio propagation, see„http://www.arrl.org/propagation[3] and the ARRL Technical Information„Service web page at, http://arrl.org/propagation-of-rf-signals[4].

Bouvet is a remote„island in the Southern Ocean, populated only by seals and penguins, and known„for treacherous weather and surf conditions. It is a territory of Norway and„nearly all of it is covered by glaciers. The most recent amateur radio„operation from Bouvet was the 3YOJ DXpedition in 2023, which moved the island„from #2 on the Club Log most wanted list to #10.ˇ„„Two camps are planned, according to team leaders, operating all HF bands, with„one camp focusing on high band propagation to North America when conditions„allow. Each camp will consist of three tents serving as operating, sleeping,„and communal spaces. These tents have previously been used on Bouvet Island and„team leaders say they have proven capable of withstanding the extreme„conditions expected.ˇ„„Plans call for the team to leave for Bouvet from Cape Town, South Africa, on„February 1. Weather permitting, 3YOK plans to use helicopter airlifts to„transport personnel and equipment between the vessel and the island. The group„expects to spend three weeks on and around the island and will attempt to„contact as many other ham radio operators around the world as they can, using„up to 8 stations operating on CW, SSB, FT8, RTTY and the QO-100 geostationary„satellite.„„The 3YOK DXpedition is perhaps the most expensive ham radio expedition ever„mounted, with a budget of $1.7 million, most of which ($1.2 million) is for„what the team refers to as a "reliable commercial Arctic / Antarctic vessel,"„noting that "(s)afe and reliable ship transportation continues to be a„challenge for such remote island expeditions, and the cost continues to rise."„Team leaders note that "the foremost priority of the 3YOK expedition is the„safety of the operating team, support personnel, and the vessel and helicopter„crews."„„The team consists of 24 operators from 14 countries. Two of the team members„are young hams, 21-year-old Max Freedman, N4ML, an ARRL staff member; and„26-year-old Alex Schengber, DL2ALY, an aviation engineer currently working at a„German research station in Antarctica.„„ˇ„„ˇ„„The Colvin Award is funded by an endowment established by the legendary DX„couple Lloyd Colvin, W6KG (SK), and Iris Colvin, W6QL (SK), both now deceased.„The award is intended to support amateur radio projects that promote„international goodwill in the field of DX.ˇˇ„„Other major financial support for the DXpedition has come from the Northern„California DX Foundation, the International DX Association, and the German DX„Foundation.ˇ„„ˇ„„ˇ„„The complete 3YOK log will be uploaded to ARRL'sˇLogbook of The World[3]®ˇ-„LoTW® - within 12 months following the DXpedition.

Amateur radio was one„of his passions.„„Dean retired from the staff of ARRL The National Association for Amateur Radio®„in 2008 following 15 years of service as the Senior Assistant Technical Editor.„„***„„In 2006, the World Radiosport Team Championship (WRTC) was held in„Florian¢polis, Brazil, a coastal city that straddles both Santa Catarina Island„and the Brazilian mainland. Not far inland, snow-capped mountains climb into„the clouds, and miles of glittering, sandy beaches ring the city. The climate„is subtropical and supports a dizzying diversity of plant and animal life from„swaying palms to visiting American tourists. Among those visiting tourists, in„this case for the WRTC as part of the PT5J team, was Dean Straw, N6BV.„Accompanying him was his beloved wife, Rayma.„„Dean was born on another island, thousands of miles from Florian¢polis, on„Honolulu in 1946. He lived there until he came to the mainland to study„electrical engineering at Yale University. After graduating, he worked in radio„design in Massachusetts at the National Radio Company, as well as in North„Carolina, San Francisco, and on Cape Cod. "He had a great ability to pull calls„out of the noise," his counterpart in PT5J in WRTC, Mark Obermann, AG9A,„recalled. "Must have had some extra processing gain inside his noggin." While„Dean and Mark wouldn't win the contest that year, they posted an impressive„score of 1,333,789. After the contest, while vacationing in Brazil, Obermann„relayed an anecdote that involved another of Straw's hobbies, competitive„running. Dean and Rayma were in Rio de Janeiro, when "a kid stole Dean's 35mm„camera." Being a long-distance runner, Dean chased after him for several miles„before it occurred to him that catching the kid might be dangerous, and that„possibly "getting killed was not worth getting the camera back." Indeed, Dean„would live many years beyond that trip to Brazil, passing away from„complications of an extended battle with Parkinson's disease. Rayma Mui, his„wife of 38 years, survives him, as do sons Geoff and Rick.„„Not only is Dean remembered among hams for his contesting prowess, but for his„tenure in the Publications Department at ARRL Headquarters. He edited five„editions of The ARRL Antenna Book (the most of any named editor), four volumes„of The ARRL Antenna Compendium (4 - 7), and several editions of The ARRL„Handbook. Former QST Editor and ARRL author Steve Ford, WB8IMY, recalled his„time with Dean. He "became my `antenna mentor' when I joined the Headquarters„staff. Until I met Dean, I didn't even know that ladder line existed" or about„its "low-loss characteristics. He helped me incorporate it into my home station„and then collaborated with me in writing a popular QST article about my„experience." The article was titled "The Lure of the Ladder Line" and appeared„in the December 1993 issue.„„Reflecting on Straw's contributions to The ARRL Antenna Book, that volume's„most recent editor, H. Ward Silver, NOAX, says, Dean's "were very big shoes to„fill. Dean started with a small book of antenna fundamentals and basic designs,„then brought it into the modern era with much more detail and a wider scope„thatˇwas groundbreaking."„„Beyond his expansion and updating of The ARRL Antenna Book, Straw wrote„modeling software that is still distributed with The Antenna Book, including„Yagi for Windows, for which he "generated a whole family of HF and VHF„designs," according to Silver. He also wrote Transmission Lines for Windows„(TLW), which "integrated several calculator-style tools into one comprehensive„package." And, arguably, his software masterpiece was High Frequency Terrain„Analysis (HFTA), which "combined terrain data and antenna patterns so that hams„could finally get a reasonably good idea of where their signal energy was„actually going.ˇHis painstakingly prepared set of Angle of Arrival files that„modeled propagation to and from many areas allowed top stations to optimize„their antenna systems to a high degree. Combined with the wide availability of„software tools like EZNEC, the effect on amateur radio antenna system design„was Promethean," again, according to Ward Silver.„„Chris Tate, N6WM, the station coordinator for Radio Oakley N6RO - the contest„station of Ken Keeler, N6RO - remembered Dean as "an instrumental antenna„design engineer." At the station, Straw contributed "massively to the antenna„farm with many unique and effective designs that gives N6RO its signature„`punch' from W6. Dean wasˇalso an expert operator, particularly in SSB, whose„recordings of his ARRL Sweepstakes operating trained and guided Northern„California Contest Club members for years."„„Friend and fellow contester, Dave Patton, KW9A, who also worked at ARRL„Headquarters with Dean, remembers him as "one of the smartest, kindest and most„innovative hams I have known." On another notable DXpedition, 4M7X on Coche„Island in Venezuela, Dean's switchable 10-element arrays for the high bands„worked so well that his team "broke the world record despite the large antenna„farm being slowly destroyed over the weekend by the remnants of a large„hurricane passing by." According to Patton, the DXpedition consisted of "43„antennas and 7 complete, 1500-watt stations."„„ARRL FCC Counsel DavidˇSiddall, K3ZJ, shared this remembrance, "his„contributions to ham radio and to ARRL will continue through his unmatched„propagation and related terrain studies, software packages (including HFTA),„articles, and other contributions to ARRL publications - many of which continue„to be widely distributed, consulted, and used almost two decades after he„retired from the ARRL."„„Dean Straw's, N6BV, legacy lives on through his many contributions to ham radio„at ARRL Headquarters and beyond, and in the countless lives he touched with his„generosity, intelligence, and love. Dean shared this message when he retired„from the ARRL staff: "The Lord has been good to me -- how many people can truly„say that their vocation has been their beloved avocation too? My wife has„consistently maintained over the years: 'You're having entirely too much fun in„this job!'"„„„„Dean's son Geoff Straw shared this tribute prepared by his family:„„Richard Dean Straw ("Dean") was born and raised in Honolulu, Hawai'i to Richard„Herbert and Mae Fuyuko Straw (nee, Sukehira) on March 1, 1946. Dean graduated a„year early from the `Iolani School in 1963 to attend Yale University, majoring„in Electrical Engineering. Dean met and married Terrianne Kreiger while„studying in New Haven, where their two sons Richard John Straw and Geoffrey„Dean Straw were born. After graduating in 1967, Dean took on increasingly more„important professional roles in the marine electronics and communications„industries, which resulted in the family's many moves in Massachusetts, North„Carolina and eventually California. Dean met his forever wife Rayma Mui in San„Francisco, where they lived for almost four decades. They traveled the world„together before Dean was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease shortly after he„retired in 2010. Dean fought the disease valiantly, with Rayma always at his„side. They continually looked to their Lord for guidance and peace. Dean passed„away in July 2025, leaving behind his loving wife Rayma in San Francisco, and„his two sons Geoff (Nancy) in San Luis Obispo, California and Rick (Christi) in„Ft. Collins, Colorado. He is also survived by five grandkids (David, Kelsey,„Katelyn, Erin, and Cassidy), four great-grandkids (Danika, Dominic, Ramona and„Ophelia), and many nieces and nephews. He was preceded in death by his parents„and his younger brother William Kirk Straw ("Kirk").ˇ„„„„Dean Straw SK„by Dave Leeson, W6NL„„Another giant of ham radio is now a silent key.

He studied to be an„electronic engineer at Yale, then joined National Radio and designed SSB and„VHF radios.[2] His career eventually led to his work at the ARRL, from which we„all benefit greatly.„„Dean was active in contesting, living in New England and then with the N6RO„superstation in California: "I'll admit it - my first love in Amateur Radio is„HF contesting."[3]„„Dean was of course familiar with the chapter on antenna siting in my 1992 book,„and when he was looking for another New England job around the same year, he„contacted me, knowing that my company California Microwave, Inc., had just„acquired Microwave Radio Corporation (Fred Collins, W1FC, president) in„Massachusetts.[4]„„That didn't work out, but he followed the recommendations of many of us who„were familiar with his ham radio interests to approach the ARRL. That clicked,„and he was there for a decade and a half, writing articles, giving talks and„editing the famous ARRL Antenna Handbook.„„While at ARRL, Straw specialized in antennas, transmission lines and„propagation. "I have been able to utilize my training as an electronics„engineer in other areas where I could help out. I've enjoyed being associated„with some remarkable people at ARRL -- folks who are truly dedicated not only„to preserving the legacy of Amateur Radio, but to taking Amateur Radio forward„in the 21st century."„„In his 15 year tenure at ARRL, Straw served as Senior Assistant Technical„Editor in the Publications Group. He was Editor of The ARRL Antenna Book for„five Editions (17th-21st Editions), Editor of The ARRL Antenna Compendium„series (Volumes 4-7), as well as several editions of The ARRL Handbook.

This was just a voluminous amount of work„that Dean did putting these results into something that was understandable to„any Amateur interested in propagation.ˇ Dean was also an avid antenna designer„and modeling expert and designed many excellent Yagi designs in the Antenna„Book.ˇ He was the editor of the ARRL Antenna Book for many years and completely„modernized the previous versions with more accuracy and technical understanding„with antenna modeling.ˇ Dean also was quite a competitive contester and was„inducted into the CQ Contest Hall of Fame.ˇ He was much competition to my K3CR„contest station in the day.ˇ One of the programs he also made was TLW [8] that„I still use a lot that can model transmission lines, loss, and tuner design.„He will be missed very much and my sincere condolences to his family and„friends.ˇ All of his work will live on by many who have used it in the past and„still use it presently.ˇ He was one of a kind for sure, and I am so honored to„have known him as a friend, collaborator, and colleague.ˇ RIP Dean N6BV SK.„„If one wants to read more about some of the history and some of the kind of„results that can be produced from Dean's HFTA, please look at the following„link:ˇ „„CTU Presents[2]„„References„„[1] Keller J., "Geometrical Theory of Diffraction,"Journal of Optical Society„of America 1962„„[2] Breakall J. et. al., "The Modeling and Measurement of HF Antenna Skywave„Radiation Patterns in Irregular Terrain," IEEE Transactions on Antennas and„Propagation, VOL. 42.

[sic] ... As ARRL notes, `[a]mateur radio licensees„not only do not sell or provide any communications service, network, or„equipment to the public, but in fact they are prohibited from doing so by both„international and domestic law.' ... The risk to national security of Foreign„Adversary Control over these licenses is minimal due to the lack of connection„to any of the nation's communications networks used by the public. We also„agree with ARRL that this reasoning applies to similar services where licenses„are held by individuals (e.g., GMRS, Commercial Radio Operators), as well as„other licenses and authorizations that lack sufficient connection to commercial„wireless communications networks in the United States. Furthermore, the„Personal Radio Services-a category that encompasses over 1.6 million unique,„mostly individual licensees-operate in shared spectrum bands for hobbyist and„safety purposes, posing little threat to national security. Similarly, we„include antenna structure owners that voluntarily register their towers in„Schedule C because they are likely to be individuals or companies that lack„sufficient connection to commercial communications networks.

In particular, much„of Europe enjoyed very favorable weather conditions thanks to an„extensive high-pressure system, the center of which slowly moved„southward from Russia across Ukraine, the Black Sea, and Turkey to„the Middle East. In its western part, a dry, cold wind blew from the„south. As a result, the aurora borealis was observed as far south as„southern Europe, for example in southern France, northern Italy, and„Romania.„„"Before the disturbance, a sunspot group AR4341, had been gradually„growing. Its magnetic configuration became increasingly complex,„while to the west and south of it lay the extensive coronal hole No.„15. Then, in a position near the center of the solar disk, very„favorable for the Earth to be hit by solar wind, a proton flare with„the highest concentration and energy of protons in the last 36 years„was observed. The beginning of the phenomenon was registered on„January 18 at 1727 UT, with a maximum at 1809 UT and an end at 1851„UT.„„"A very fast particle ejection (CME) began on January 18 at 1748 UT,„lasted 5 hours, while was best observed around 1812 UT. The particle„flow velocity was extreme, ranging from 2900 up to 3500 km/s.„Therefore, the geomagnetic disturbance did not begin two to three„days after the flare, as is usual, but the very next day - January„19. The aurora borealis was visible for most of the night from„January 19 to 20, and even at mid-latitudes it had not only the„usual red color, but also, exceptionally, green.„„"The G4 geomagnetic disturbance lasted 15 hours and was followed by„a G3 disturbance lasting 18 hours.

There are both online and offline versions, however, for the best experience, I reccomend DL'ing VICE, which can emulate all of Commodore's 8-bit micros, including the 64, of course.„„ > How do you like it ?„„The hardware is top notch.  I got the BASIC Beige version, which matches the original 64 to a T, except for the back and right side where all the ports/ connections go.  The keyboard has a nice, solid feel to it, with a satisfying CLACK when you type. The layout is a bit different from a PC keyboard, and the keycaps are a bit smaller, so I had to get used to that.  One thing missing is a dimple on the F and J keys; very helpful if you're a touch-typist.  I was a smidge dissapointed that the function keys weren't available in gray, which appeared on the early 64s, but no big.„„As for the software, I'm only dissapointed that the BASIC wasn't the more advancd version from the 128.  For a product called "Ultimate", sticking with the 2.0 version falls short, IMO.  It's not all bad, though.  There's a system configuration utility, file browser and networking all built-in.„„ > I am curious what applications they may have?„„According to Commodore, about 90% of C=64 programs will run on the 64U.  The ones most likely effected wil be those having certain hardware requirements, like those using the User Port, which weren't many.  Of course, new programs are being written all the time.„„---„ ˛ Synchronet ˛ End Of The Line BBS - endofthelinebbs.com„                          1644   01-12-2604:38Denn                     R4                       Well this is fun                     1604    9     ·©     Re: Well this is fun„  By: Denn to Bf2k+ on Sun Jan 04 2026 08:33 am„„ >   Re: Well this is fun„ >   By: Bf2k+ to Denn on Sat Jan 03 2026 10:15 pm„ > „ >  >> I have a few emulators for the Tandy Color Computer, I really would'nt„ >  >> want to buy another CoCo, I have used the emulator to write a few CoCo„ >  >> basic programs, just for a little nostagia.„ > „ >  Bf> I run my Atari 8-bit BBS on a Windows PC using the Altirra emulator for„ >  Bf> Atari.

I found it's best to host/serve the files from the Linux system using Samba and have Windows be the "client" in the relationship. I've experimented with using Windows as the SMB server and the results were not good. Also, for best results, have your Linux system *mount* the Samba-shared directory and use the mounted folder (not the source/shared folder) - that way all the file and record locking between the two systems works as it should.„„You pretty much need to share the entire sbbs directory hierarchy. Technically, there are some files (and very few directories) that don't need to be shared, but it's not really worth the hassle to try to describe and figure out which is which. Just share the entire sbbs directory tree.„„You just need to copy your ctrl/sbbs.ini file to another name in the same directory (e.g. sbbs.hostname.ini), change the FirstNode and LastNode values (so the 2 sbbs*.ini files don't overlap with nodes) and update/check the network settings, and you should be able to run the 2 instances concurrently.„„I tried the same with macOS as a client it's SMB/CIFS client sucks too hard.„-- „                                            digital man (rob)„„Synchronet/BBS Terminology Definition #76:„SPF = Sender Policy Framework„Norco, CA WX: 53.5¯F, 27.0% humidity, 0 mph ENE wind, 0.00 inches rain/24hrs„---„ ˛ Synchronet ˛ Vertrauen ˛ Home of Synchronet ˛ [vert/cvs/bbs].synchro.net„                                                                                                           9563   01-29-2610:33All                      RickV                    Foreign Address question             0       9     ·Æ   Hello everybody!„„When I send any fidonet mail, I get this "Foreign address" entry in my sbbsecho.log.

only spawns a single fish„- it saves the user-game data in the current directory instead of the "correct"„  path/filename (data/user/####.*)„- the saved-game data (json) isn't versioned, so it really
